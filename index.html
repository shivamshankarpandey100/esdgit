                    Employee skill development is a crucial aspect of employee 
                    training and development programs. Upskilling and reskilling 
                    employees is the primary focus of L&D programs in 2022, 
                    as it helps workers meet organizational standards, 
                    reduces replacement costs, and improves workplace 
                    performance.2 Employee training programs help employees
                     learn specific knowledge or skills to improve performance
                      in their current roles, while employee development focuses
                       on employee growth and future performance, rather than an
                        immediate job role.1 High-impact training and development
                         programs don't just happen, and managers and employees
                          work together to create a development plan that 
                          identifies areas to develop or enhance and ascertains
                           what actions or activities need to be taken to acquire
                            and embed that learning. </i>
